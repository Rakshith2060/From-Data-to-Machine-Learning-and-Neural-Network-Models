I have chosen a dataset from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/clean-air-markets-allowances-querywizard data.gov, specifically from the https://campd.epa.gov/data/bulk-data-files Clean Air 
Markets Program Data Application (CAMPD). This application, accessible at CAMPD, allows 
users to view and download Clean Air Markets data hourly, monthly and yearly. 
EPA's Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) oversees several market-based regulatory programs 
designed to improve air quality and protect ecosystems. Notable programs include EPA's Acid 
Rain Program and the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) Programs, which aim to reduce 
emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), compounds that negatively impact 
air quality, the environment, and public health. 
From this application, I have downloaded the emissions hourly dataset for the year 2023. which 
includes various features related to emissions, such as SO2 Mass, Heat Input, NOx Mass, CO2 
Mass, and operational parameters like Gross Load and Operating Time. The target variable for 
the analysis is the NOx Rate (lbs/mmBtu).

The goal of this analysis is to predict the NOx Rate (lbs/mmBtu), which is the rate of nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) emissions per unit of heat input for industrial facilities. Nitrogen oxides are 
important pollutants that contribute to issues related to the environment such as smog and acid 
rain, making it crucial to understand and predict their emission rates accurately.

This problem falls under the category of supervised regression. In supervised learning, we have a 
dataset with input features and a corresponding target variable, and the task is to learn a mapping 
from inputs to the target.
Supervised Learning: We have labeled data where the target variable (NOx Rate) is known for 
each observation.
Regression Task: As the target variable, that is NOx Rate (lbs/mmBtu), is continuous and 
numerical, this makes this a regression problem
